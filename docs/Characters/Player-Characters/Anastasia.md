## Backstory

Born under the canopy of ancient trees, Anastasia's life began with promise and hope. Her family, renowned for their mastery of arcane arts, raised her with love and reverence for the natural world. From a tender age, Anastasia displayed an innate gift for magic, particularly in the arts of healing and divination. Her keen intellect and thirst for knowledge led her to pursue the path of a sage. However, Anastasia's idyllic life was shattered when her homeland fell to the forces of a tyrannical warlord. In the chaos of battle, Anastasia was captured and sold into slavery, her once bright future now clouded by the shadow of oppression. For years, Anastasia endured the hardships of servitude, her hands bound not by choice, but by chains forged from cruelty and despair. Forced to serve a ruthless master in a distant land, she used her skills as a healer to tend to the wounds of her fellow slaves, offering what solace she could in the face of their suffering. Despite the darkness that surrounded her, Anastasia never lost sight of her purpose. In the quiet moments between her duties, she delved into her studies with a fervor born of desperation, seeking solace in the ancient tomes and scrolls she had managed to conceal. As the years passed, Anastasia's reputation as a healer and sage grew among the slaves, earning her the respect and admiration of her fellow captives. With her guidance, they found strength in unity, their spirits bolstered by the hope of eventual freedom. And when the opportunity for escape finally presented itself, Anastasia seized it with all the determination and courage that had sustained her through years of hardship. Leading her fellow slaves in a daring revolt against their oppressors, she unleashed the full extent of her magical prowess, weaving spells of protection and healing to shield her companions from harm. In the end, their efforts were rewarded, and Anastasia emerged from the crucible of slavery not as a broken captive, but as a beacon of hope and resilience. With her newfound freedom, she vowed to continue her journey as a healer and sage, using her gifts to bring light to the darkest corners of the world and to stand as a testament to the indomitable spirit of the elven people.
