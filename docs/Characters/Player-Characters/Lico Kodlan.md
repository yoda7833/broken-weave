## Backstory
Lico was born 40 years ago in Blood Gulch to her halfling parents, [[Regis]] and [[Haara]] who had recently settled in Blood Gulch. She has 2 older siblings, [[Lekath]] and [[Kelsys]]. She was never particularly close to her family growing up but not for lack of trying, she’s just awkward. Life in Blood Gulch was not particularly easy, with weird blood spurting out of the ground that you could never be sure was safe, illnesses rampant, and the rare monster attacks you were in danger at almost any time, at least that’s how it felt for Lico.

When she was a young child her older sister, [[Kelsys]], the older one of her siblings, had already become a prominent cook for the community. Lico joined her in cooking for a while, and even found cooking to be enjoyable, but not when it's for a large number of people. She much preferred cooking small meals. As she grew older she joined her mother Haara in tool smithing, learning how to perform basic repairs and craft basic tools, but she wasn’t adept at it and decided that the community likely had much better candidates to be her mother’s apprentice. She does still keep the artificer’s tools her mom gave her close by, especially the hammer her mom had given her as a present on her birthday. 

Her true calling came in the form of her father and brother, both respected militia members in the village, despite the different roles they played. Her father, Regis, was a guardsman for the village and had been since they first arrived. When she first joined the militia she was assigned to work with her father and train to protect the village from threats. He trained her in hand to hand combat and on how to utilize a bow, he even entrusted her with his jeweled dagger, a family heirloom. While she was okay with protecting the village and a skilled guard it did become apparent her skills were better suited to life outside the walls like her brother [[Lekath]]. She was skilled at sneaking up on prey and excelled at spotting problems before they became problems. She’d hoped to be like her brother and go out hunting rare artifacts and beasts, but with her understanding of the local ecosystem and the area around the haven she instead became a mapper. She would scout trails and learn safe places for merchants to travel.

Lico may not lead the exciting life far from home like [[Lekath]] but she did at least get to feel satisfied about her place in the world, and there were some interesting times near home, like when she met [[Bopper]]. While out mapping the roads to nearby havens she saved a baby Chichit from a trap, she was intending to just release it back to the wild, but when it came time for the Chichit to leave it scurried up her arm and rested on her shoulder, so now Lico has a pet that she named Bopper. Another interesting encounter was meeting [[Thibble]], while out on a hunt she found a dwarven man who was wandering the land not too far from Blood Gulch. She watched him for a few hours to see what he was doing before realizing he was clearly lost as he had gone in a large circle, so she came out of hiding and offered to show him to the haven. That was the start of one of her only friendships and [[Thibble]], who decided to reside in [[Blood Gulch]], is one of the few people she regularly talks to in town aside from [[Bopper]]. Not every encounter outside of the haven is a good one though, there was the time she and [[Maria]], a fellow militia member were out scouting and a pack of wild wolves overwhelmed us, she didn’t even hesitate to use Lico as bait and bolt. Luckily, Lico could climb and managed to scramble up a tree and hide out until the wolves got bored and left. When Lico got back to the haven Maria was already there and had reported her missing in action, they haven’t gotten along since then. Still despite there being excitement at home Lico does hope to go out like her brother and explore one day. She has a piece of cloth [[Lekath]] gave her that he supposedly took off the corpse of a dead god that he discovered and when she holds the cloth while she sleeps, she swears she dreams of that god’s corpse and wants to go see it herself one day.
