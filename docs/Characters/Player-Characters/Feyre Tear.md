## Backstory

Generations ago, the **House of Tear** was a pillar of Blood Gulch. The family was known for the martial strength they used to defend the Haven and their graceful devotion to the moon and the silent god that they fervently held hope in. However that hope would be tested as the family fell into ruin. Feyre' grandfather, [[Tidus Tear]] turned away someone who had claimed to be a follower of the moon (potential NPC) before continuing on their journey they cursed him and his house for lacking faith in his goddess. The traveler then returned back into the world between not to be seen in blood gulch since. On his next adventure, Tidus was gravely injured and was stumbling back to the Haven when he turned into a Husk. stricken by grief Feyre's father struggled to kill the husk and was crippled in the process. The ancestral armor has been reduced to scraps but was repaired into a patchwork plate set. Feyre was 8 when this tragedy struck and her family's influence and strength had seemingly vanished overnight. their fortune dwindled until it ran out 5 years later. At 13 Feyre started work as the town watch to provide for her 2 sisters and her crippled father. the seemingly endless nights drove her near madness. the one thing that kept her sane was the godly light of the moon shining down and forcing the shadows back. over the next 6 years of near starvation Feyre would hold secret meetings to worship the moon goddess only inviting those she was willing to trust.  
those that join her became a second family too her that she would protect no matter what
