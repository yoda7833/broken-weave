### Backstory
[[Guspra Hermanhed]] was born into a small haven not too dissimilar to the one where the current campaign takes place; wherein his family owned and operated
a highly acclaimed healing house within which he worked to assist the citizens of his haven by perfecting his own abilities as a maker. He studied under his father, an accomplished alchemist, which spurned his own desire to become an alchemist. 

[[Guspra Hermanhed]]'s home eventually fell apart when extreme earthquakes decimated homes and collapsed buildings which lead to the death of Guspra's parents as well as many of the haven's other dwellers. Now alone [[Guspra Hermanhed]] at the age of 18 ventured out to find a new home with hopes of one day coming back and restoring his fallen home. Following the demise of his haven, Guspra comes upon the site of the current campaign, a Costal haven going by the name Blood Gulch. With a population of around 150 individuals Blood Gulch faced its own share of challenges and Guspra was eager to lend his assistance.

Initially [[Guspra Hermanhed]] served as a Beastkeeper for a short period of time. Following this he attained some fame within the haven for providing quality craftsmanship. He was became an apprentice at the local makers workshop where he further honed his abilities.

[[Guspra Hermanhed]] continued to hone his abilities in alchemy and had difficulty finding an effective way to test the effects of the potions he created. Luckily he met an unlikely soul by the name of [[Itkovian]] who would (for a small price) ingest any and all potions provided to him. 

[[Guspra Hermanhed]] was also given a multitude of tasks from haven leadership and was once sent on an excursion with [[Lico Kodlan]] into the wilderness. There they lost their way and were forced to survive for a short time before they were able to find their way home.

After working for a few years within the Haven [[Guspra Hermanhed]] had afforded himself some fame within the haven and was given his own dwellings for his contributions to the betterment of the haven and its community. Here [[Guspra Hermanhed]] would spend his off time. One day though, a group of refugees had come to the gates of the haven and were given refuge in Blood Gulch. Among these refugees was [[Nemohziin]], an individual of Forgotten lineage, who was looking worse for wear. Out the kindness of his heart [[Guspra Hermanhed]] allowed [[Nemohziin]] into his home.
