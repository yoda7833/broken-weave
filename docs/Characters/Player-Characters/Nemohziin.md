## Backstory
Nemohziin has spent nearly his entire life inside his kin's haven with other wyrmlings. His role within the haven was that of an ascetic, training in the local monastery in a martial discipline that uses the unique anatomy wyrmlings possess, focusing on an aerial unarmed fighting style. 

The haven was destroyed by an unnaturally large wave of Decay that swept through the haven. The denizens that weren't immediately erased by the Decay scattered in unorganized attempts to quickly pilgrimage to the next nearest havens to escape the decay as fast as possible. 

It didn't seem to help much. Even after weeks of meditation on the subjects, Nemohziin can only recall 3 other Wyrmlings to memory: [[Sothiis]], his sister and former librarian of the haven, [[Hestiin]], a gardener, and [[Jiiri]], a fellow practitioner and ascetic from a higher rank within the monastery Nemohziin trained at. Nemohziin assumes everyone else is lost to the Decay, even his and [[Sothiis]]' parents, who he only knows exist thanks to a locket he keeps with a picture of all 4 of them inside. Nemohziin cannot even recall details about the Haven.

Nemohziin, after fleeing the Haven, was forced to fend for himself as he travelled. The only reason he was able to escape the Decay was that he was able to assume some level control over the Decay coursing through his own body even as it threatened to erase him like it had his kin. However, because of his monstrous appearance and the overt influence of Decay on him, he has been turned away or chased out of any Haven he has tried to approach and start a new life. 

Nemohziin's path now is paradoxical. Tired from travelling and being barred from other havens, Nemohziin wishes to find a safe haven to call home. However he simultaneously wishes to find the three of his kin he can still recall, and must travel to find them.
