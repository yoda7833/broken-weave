## Backstory
Grew up in a secret cult worshiping the old gods as if they were alive still- led to weird beliefs like believing that all halflings or dwarves are human children and that he is a wizard that can do magic (he can’t, he just shouts spell names while doing normal things)

Tries to convince people that strange theories are real, like the gods being real and that party members are a different race then they are, and tries to talk people into joining his cult, [[Feyre Tear]], who was down.

The event that killed his family, and the entire cult he grew up in when he was 15- the leader of the cult led everyone into the wilderness to fulfill some prophecy about the gods ‘revealing’ themselves again through some ritual he was gonna do, instead the cult leader did the lvl 19 preacher thing where he turns into a titan and he killed the whole cult except for him, then wandered off to do some titan shit. (could be the haven start escape the monster our families were becoming)  He saw this as the ultimate obeisance to the gods and from then on aspired to share the same fate as the cult leader one day. 

After being set out on the streets after the titan thing he made money by letting alchemists test alchemical potions on him, which furthered his mental decline and made him even crazier- one of the alchemists is [[Guspra Hermanhed]]
