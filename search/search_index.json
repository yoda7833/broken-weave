Her family, renowned for their mastery of arcane arts, raised her with love and reverence for the natural world. From a tender age, Anastasia displayed an innate gift for magic, particularly in the arts of healing and divination. Her keen intellect and thirst for knowledge led her to pursue the path of a sage. However, Anastasia's idyllic life was shattered when her homeland fell to the forces of a tyrannical warlord. In the chaos of battle, Anastasia was captured and sold into slavery, her once bright future now clouded by the shadow of oppression. For years, Anastasia endured the hardships of servitude, her hands bound not by choice, but by chains forged from cruelty and despair. Forced to serve a ruthless master in a distant land, she used her skills as a healer to tend to the wounds of her fellow slaves, offering what solace she could in the face of their suffering. Despite the darkness that surrounded her, Anastasia never lost sight of her purpose. In the quiet moments between her duties, she delved into her studies with a fervor born of desperation, seeking solace in the ancient tomes and scrolls she had managed to conceal. As the years passed, Anastasia's reputation as a healer and sage grew among the slaves, earning her the respect and admiration of her fellow captives. With her guidance, they found strength in unity, their spirits bolstered by the hope of eventual freedom. And when the opportunity for escape finally presented itself, Anastasia seized it with all the determination and courage that had sustained her through years of hardship. Leading her fellow slaves in a daring revolt against their oppressors, she unleashed the full extent of her magical prowess, weaving spells of protection and healing to shield her companions from harm. In the end, their efforts were rewarded, and Anastasia emerged from the crucible of slavery not as a broken captive, but as a beacon of hope and resilience. With her newfound freedom, she vowed to continue her journey as a healer and sage, using her gifts to bring light to the darkest corners of the world and to stand as a testament to the indomitable spirit of the elven people.</p>"},{"location":"Characters/Player-Characters/Anastasia/#character-pc","title":"character #pc","text":""},{"location":"Characters/Player-Characters/Feyre%20Tear/","title":"Feyre Tear","text":""},{"location":"Characters/Player-Characters/Feyre%20Tear/#character-details","title":"Character details","text":"<p>Lineage: Human</p> <p>Class: Warden</p> <p>player: David</p>"},{"location":"Characters/Player-Characters/Feyre%20Tear/#visual-discription","title":"visual discription","text":"<p>wip</p>"},{"location":"Characters/Player-Characters/Feyre%20Tear/#backstory","title":"Backstory","text":"<p>Generations ago, the House of Tear was a pillar of Blood Gulch.

She has 2 older siblings, Lekath and Kelsys. She was never particularly close to her family growing up but not for lack of trying, she\u2019s just awkward. Life in Blood Gulch was not particularly easy, with weird blood spurting out of the ground that you could never be sure was safe, illnesses rampant, and the rare monster attacks you were in danger at almost any time, at least that\u2019s how it felt for Lico.</p> <p>When she was a young child her older sister, Kelsys, the older one of her siblings, had already become a prominent cook for the community. Lico joined her in cooking for a while, and even found cooking to be enjoyable, but not when it's for a large number of people. She much preferred cooking small meals. As she grew older she joined her mother Haara in tool smithing, learning how to perform basic repairs and craft basic tools, but she wasn\u2019t adept at it and decided that the community likely had much better candidates to be her mother\u2019s apprentice. She does still keep the artificer\u2019s tools her mom gave her close by, especially the hammer her mom had given her as a present on her birthday. </p> <p>Her true calling came in the form of her father and brother, both respected militia members in the village, despite the different roles they played. Her father, Regis, was a guardsman for the village and had been since they first arrived. When she first joined the militia she was assigned to work with her father and train to protect the village from threats. He trained her in hand to hand combat and on how to utilize a bow, he even entrusted her with his jeweled dagger, a family heirloom. While she was okay with protecting the village and a skilled guard it did become apparent her skills were better suited to life outside the walls like her brother Lekath. She was skilled at sneaking up on prey and excelled at spotting problems before they became problems. She\u2019d hoped to be like her brother and go out hunting rare artifacts and beasts, but with her understanding of the local ecosystem and the area around the haven she instead became a mapper. She would scout trails and learn safe places for merchants to travel.</p> <p>Lico may not lead the exciting life far from home like Lekath but she did at least get to feel satisfied about her place in the world, and there were some interesting times near home, like when she met Bopper. While out mapping the roads to nearby havens she saved a baby Chichit from a trap, she was intending to just release it back to the wild, but when it came time for the Chichit to leave it scurried up her arm and rested on her shoulder, so now Lico has a pet that she named Bopper. Another interesting encounter was meeting Thibble, while out on a hunt she found a dwarven man who was wandering the land not too far from Blood Gulch. She watched him for a few hours to see what he was doing before realizing he was clearly lost as he had gone in a large circle, so she came out of hiding and offered to show him to the haven. That was the start of one of her only friendships and Thibble, who decided to reside in Blood Gulch, is one of the few people she regularly talks to in town aside from Bopper. Not every encounter outside of the haven is a good one though, there was the time she and Maria, a fellow militia member were out scouting and a pack of wild wolves overwhelmed us, she didn\u2019t even hesitate to use Lico as bait and bolt. Luckily, Lico could climb and managed to scramble up a tree and hide out until the wolves got bored and left. When Lico got back to the haven Maria was already there and had reported her missing in action, they haven\u2019t gotten along since then. Still despite there being excitement at home Lico does hope to go out like her brother and explore one day. She has a piece of cloth Lekath gave her that he supposedly took off the corpse of a dead god that he discovered and when she holds the cloth while she sleeps, she swears she dreams of that god\u2019s corpse and wants to go see it herself one day.</p>"},{"location":"Characters/Player-Characters/Lico%20Kodlan/#character-pc","title":"character #pc","text":""},{"location":"Characters/Player-Characters/Nemohziin/","title":"Nemohziin","text":""},{"location":"Characters/Player-Characters/Nemohziin/#character-details","title":"Character details","text":"<p>Lineage: Forgotten (bludgeoning unarmed attacks, wings)</p> <p>Class: Harbinger</p> <p>player: JK7</p>"},{"location":"Characters/Player-Characters/Nemohziin/#visual-description","title":"visual description","text":"<p>kind of like a tiefling, so red skin, horns, wings, but the horns and wings are more draconic than devilish. knuckles are covered with a natural armor so they hit harder. no tail. 5'8\", yellow eyes, vertical slit black iris pupils (basically tieflings but they descend from dragons not devils).
